BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

The project is a mobile application to simplify the interaction
of concert managers and artists. Concert managers will be able to create
events, assign performers to them, combine them into groups, and find them in
a common database. Performers can also see current events, find new
events in their city.
The goal of the project is to make the process of interaction between the two above
-mentioned groups as comfortable and simple as possible

CREATING AN ERD MODEL

When drawing up an ER model (ER diagrams, ERD), it is important to work out in detail
the entities and their connectivity with each other, based on the functional task. The
company has developed an internal standard for the design of an ER diagram. Everything
is detailed there.

API SPECIFICATION FOR SWAGGER

It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that the backend part of the platform will be based on
a microservice architecture and for each service it is necessary to allocate its own
a yaml file, and then merge everything into a single root file.
